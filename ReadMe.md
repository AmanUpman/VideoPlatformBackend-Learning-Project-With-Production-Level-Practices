🎯 Video Platform Backend — Learning Project with Production-Level Practices

This project is a learning-focused backend application built to practice and implement production-level coding standards. The goal is to simulate the backend of a video viewing platform, focusing on essential features and secure architecture that reflect real-world systems.

It is built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose, along with JWT, bcrypt, and other standard tools and libraries used in modern backend development.

📌 About the Project

This project aims to replicate the core backend functionality of a video hosting platform. While the focus is on learning, the structure and implementation are designed to mirror best practices used in production environments.

It includes features such as:
- User authentication (signup and login)
- Secure password handling with bcrypt
- Token-based access and refresh authentication using JWT
- Video upload and management
- Like and dislike functionality
- Commenting and replies
- Subscribe and unsubscribe to channels

🛠️ Tech Stack

- Node.js and Express.js for server-side development
- MongoDB and Mongoose for database management
- JWT for access and refresh token-based authentication
- Bcrypt for password hashing
- Additional middleware and utilities for modularity and maintainability

🎯 Learning Goals

- Apply standard backend practices in a practical, hands-on project
- Understand and implement secure authentication flows
- Work with structured data models and relationships using Mongoose
- Practice organizing code in a modular, maintainable way
- Simulate real backend logic behind a media platform

🙌 Note

This project was built with the goal of strengthening backend development skills by working through a feature-complete, realistic backend system. It serves as a practice ground for exploring clean architecture, authentication mechanisms, and backend logic — useful for both learning and showcasing backend capabilities.
